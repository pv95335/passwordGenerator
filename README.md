# Password Generator Starter Code
For this assignment I was tasked to create a script that would allow the user to click a button that would generate a random password. The user would choose the properties they would like for their generated password such as lowercase and uppercase letters, random numbers and random symbols and finally the length of their password. All of these properties would be chosen in confirm window alerts and would affect the script to create a password using these properties. During this project I was able to create a script that would randomly choose the lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. I managed to get these properties into window alerts that would only pop out when the generate password button was pressed. I was unable to figure out how to have the user choose the length of the password as well as implement these variables into a fuinction that would generate the password.
